# MyRepositoryIFCA-MiVa
An IIFC approach for missing data

# My Project
## Key Elements Summary

- **Challenge:** Handling missing data in real-world datasets is difficult due to uncertainty, scalability, and mixed (numerical and categorical) feature types.

- **Limitations of Traditional Methods:** Often use point estimates, which inadequately represent uncertainty.

- **Hybrid Model:** We propose a combination of fuzzy clustering (to model latent structures and uncertainty via fuzzy memberships) with gradient-boosted regression for accurate predictions.

- **Evaluation:** Tested on twelve UCI datasets with artificially introduced missingness at 10% under MCAR mechanism.

- **Performance:** Outperforms advanced methods like GAIN and MIDA in both imputation accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Contributions:** Improves imputation quality, interpretability, and scalability.

- **Scope:** Applicable across diverse data scenarios with mixed data types.
